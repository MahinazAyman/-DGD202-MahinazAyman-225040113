I have used AI for the codes and i used youtube tutorial for the menu.
I have tried to do all the requriments but it's not working for me.
Everytime I try to add c# script component to the spheres the player stops to move and any slight change it affects the player and I redo all the codes again.
I hope this won't make me fail this course.
